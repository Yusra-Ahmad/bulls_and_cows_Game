## Game Rules 🎯
Bulls and Cows is a two-player game, but this implementation is single-player with the computer generating the secret code. Here's how the game works:

➡️ The computer generates a secret code, and the player's task is to guess it.

➡️ The code consists of a sequence of digits (e.g., 4 digits).

➡️ The player makes a guess by entering a sequence of digits.

➡️ After each guess, the game provides feedback in the form of "Bulls" 🐂 and "Cows" 🐄.

➡️ A "Bull" means a correct digit in the correct position.

➡️ A "Cow" means a correct digit in the wrong position.

➡️ The player continues guessing until they correctly identify the entire secret code or reach the maximum number of attempts.

➡️ Continue guessing until you correctly identify the secret code or reach the maximum number of attempts.

➡️ Enjoy the challenge and have fun! 😄
